# Network Analysis of Twitter Follower Networks for Research

This project is used to analyze a dataset of Tweets using #unitetheright 
during an 11 day period in August 2017. This period corresponds with the 
rally in Charlottesville for the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue. 

Tweets were collected by Ed Summers and archived by DocNow.

This program collects users from a Tweet database, retrieves their friends
(i.e., followees), and exports csv files for nodes and edges. These files can 
be imported into Gephi or NodeXL for further analysis.
